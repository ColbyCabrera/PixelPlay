- **Modern UI**: A beautiful and responsive UI built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 Expressive, supporting Dynamic Color and dark/light themes.
- **Music Library**: Organize and browse your music by songs, albums, and artists.
- **Widget**: Control your music from the home screen with a Glance-based app widget.
- **Tag Editor**: Edit song metadata (title, artist, album, etc.) with the built-in tag editor.
- **AI-Powered Features**: Explore advanced features powered by Gemini for a unique listening experience.
